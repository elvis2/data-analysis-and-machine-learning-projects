# Introduction

In July of 2020, I finished the AWS Machine Learning course at Udacity. Lesson 5 was dedicated to learning about Generative AI, AWS DeepComposer and how to build a custom Generative Adversarial Network.

# ML Techniques & Generative AI

I enjoyed learning how Generative AI and GANs work, and the differences between Generative AI vs Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning vs Reinforcement Learning.

# AWS Deep Composer

The lesson continued into the AWS DeepComposer, explaining how the workflow and roles of the Generator and Discriminator models of the service. 

I stepped through the DeepComposer UI to compose a 4-part accompaniment of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star by modifying the model parameters.

# Final

DeepComposer is a fun way to apply Generative AI. Overtime, as AWS adds more models, the service can really take on a different role of creating music purely via AI.

The costs of learning GANs through DeepComposer were minimal, allowing for more test runs and model parameters changes.
